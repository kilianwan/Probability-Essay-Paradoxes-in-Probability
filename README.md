# Probability Essay: Borel-Kolmogorov and Bertrand's Paradoxes

Authors: *Eliot Dugelay* and *Kilian Wan*

Overview
This repository contains the essay "Probability Essay: Borel-Kolmogorov and Bertrand's Paradoxes" by Eliot Dugelay and Kilian Wan. This essay explores two intriguing paradoxes in probability theory:

*Borel-Kolmogorov Paradox*: This paradox deals with the conditional probability in cases where the event has a probability of zero. It questions the well-defined nature of conditional probabilities when conditioning on events of measure zero, providing examples to demonstrate the paradox.

*Bertrandâ€™s Paradox*: This paradox presents an issue in classical probability theory where the probability of a random chord being longer than the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle changes based on how the random chords are chosen. Different selection methods lead to different probabilities, highlighting the ambiguity in the problem.
